# Histopathological-Cancer-Identification
The project explores the usage of the Convolutional Nueral Network using the Keras library to classify a histopathologic image as cancerous or non-cancerous. 

The data used was imported from the kaggle platform. It involves basic steps taken to use a very simple convolutional network to predict an image. Prelinary Augmentation was carried out only as the image library was quite large. The architecure involved a combination of convolutional layers, maxpooling and normalization with the dropout used at the end before the output was generated. It is a fairly simple model which can be tweaked further to enhance accuracy substantially.
